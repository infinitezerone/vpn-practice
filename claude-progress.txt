# Claude Progress Log
Rules:
- Only change "passes" fields in feature_list.json when marking features done.
- Append a dated summary line for each work session.

- 2026-02-13: Initialized long-running agent harness (init.sh, feature_list.json, claude-progress.txt). No app features implemented yet.
- 2026-02-13: Implemented initial Compose UI (Start/Stop) and VPN permission flow; added VpnService stub and manifest entry. Marked F001-F003 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added proxy host/port form with validation and persistence (SharedPreferences), wired Start button enablement to valid config, passed unit tests and debug build. Marked F004/F005/F006/F024/F031 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added bypass app selector with persistence, upgraded VPN service to foreground mode with notification and TUN builder (IPv4/default route/DNS), applied addDisallowedApplication, and passed unit tests + debug build. Marked F007/F008/F009/F010/F011/F012/F013/F028 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added runtime VPN state + logs, proxy connection test button, bypass app search, and service error reporting for proxy failures/revoke. Passed unit tests + debug build. Marked F016/F018/F019/F022/F023/F025/F029 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added routing mode toggle (bypass/allowlist) and service-side proxy retry with backoff before fail. Passed unit tests + debug build. Marked F014/F017 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added auto-reconnect at boot toggle + receiver, network-change status handling, and endpoint sanitization in logs/notifications. Passed unit tests + debug build. Marked F020/F021/F026/F030 as passing.
- 2026-02-13: Added IPv6 optional routing fallback and a Compose instrumentation UI test skeleton for Start button validation. Debug + unit + androidTest APK assembly passed. `connectedDebugAndroidTest` blocked (no connected device), so F032 remains pending.
- 2026-02-13: Emulator connected and `connectedDebugAndroidTest` passed (2 tests). Added HTTP proxy bridge hint in VPN builder (`setHttpProxy`), plus host normalization in connectivity checks. Marked F032 as passing. F015 remains pending for full TUN packet forwarding implementation.
- 2026-02-13: Integrated native tun2socks bridge (`hevtunnel`) with generated SOCKS5 config and lifecycle stop handling. Unit/build/connected tests passed. F015 still pending until on-device traffic forwarding is manually validated.
